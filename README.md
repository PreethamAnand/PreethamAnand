## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science undergraduate** with a strong focus on **Python, AI/ML, and open-source development**.  
I enjoy building **real-world, data-driven systems** and understanding how machine learning solutions scale in production.

- 💡 Learn best by **building projects**
- 🌱 Growing through **open-source contributions**
- 🧠 Strengthening fundamentals via **DSA & problem solving**
- 🎯 Long-term goal: **Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026**

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building **AI/ML projects** with clean, production-oriented code
- Exploring **ML lifecycle & experimentation tools** (MLflow, DVC)
- Practicing **DSA (Linked Lists, Arrays, Core Structures)** on LeetCode
- Writing readable, maintainable, and documented Python code
- Preparing for **GSoC 2026 contribution workflows**

## 🔓 Open Source Interests

I’m especially interested in contributing to open-source projects related to:

- 🔹 Machine Learning tooling & experimentation platforms  
- 🔹 Model lifecycle management (training, tracking, evaluation)
- 🔹 Data pipelines & ML infrastructure
- 🔹 Python-based developer tools
- 🔹 AI systems with real-world impact

> Actively looking to collaborate and learn through meaningful open-source contributions.
